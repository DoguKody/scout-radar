#---------NOTES---------
# Here are some edge cases I am likely to deal with:

# 1. Topic Channel Ranks Higher Than Official Channel
#    - Some artists may not rank in the top 5 results.
#    - Topic channels (e.g., "Superheaven - Topic") may appear first due to distribution metadata.
#    - Heuristic: deprioritize channels with no handle/custom URL and " - Topic" in title.

# 2. Same Artist Name Shared by Multiple Unrelated Channels
#    - E.g., ‚ÄúHerne‚Äù could refer to an indie artist, a podcast, or a cultural group.
#    - Heuristic: use keyword search like "Herne official music video" and cross-check video uploaders.

# 3. Official Channel Has Low Engagement or No Custom URL
#    - Emerging or underground artists may have few subscribers or no branding setup.
#    - Heuristic: prioritize channels that upload official content (albums, music videos), not just promo clips.

# 4. Label or Collective Channel Hosts the Artist ('I assume this is unlikely for upcoming artist but we will see.')
#    - Some artists primarily post under their label's or group's YouTube (e.g., Stones Throw, Boiler Room).
#    - Heuristic: check if multiple known artists are posted under one channel, then tag accordingly.

# 5. Multiple Active Channels for One Artist ('Super edge case that might fall out of scope for now, but definitely a consideration.')
#    - Some artists split content: ‚ÄúArtist Official‚Äù for music, ‚ÄúArtist Vlogs‚Äù for behind-the-scenes.
#    - Heuristic: build logic to flag duplicates and compare activity stats (uploads, recency, views).
